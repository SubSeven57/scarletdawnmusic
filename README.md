Repository for scores and sources of music created by Scarlet Dawn (me)

# What do? 
Basically, this is the source files for the scores. It'll take me a while to score every song, but I will do it! No actual song files are present here. For that, either go to Spotify and look for "Scarlet Dawn" or scarletdawn.bandcamp.com

The actual MP3s are in a CC-BY-SA license (unless otherwise noted), so go crazy!
